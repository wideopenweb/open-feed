# open-feed
Open Feed is a social media feed on top of a GitHub repo.  It expects the repo to be in a particular format, then renders it.

Here's an example: https://wideopenweb.github.io/open-feed/index.html?owner=benofben&repo=benlackey-feed&path=posts

## Roadmap
* GitHub login to deal with API throttle
* Comments - likely auth'd with GitHub
* Intermingle multiple feeds
* Better date handling -- maybe show created and updated but sort by updated?
* Improve Preview -- right now it just says open-feed.  Could have information on the feed or show the title and image from a particular post if one is being linked.
