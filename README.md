# open-feed
Open Feed is a social media feed on top of a GitHub repo.  It expects the repo to be in a particular format, then renders it.

Here's an example: https://wideopenweb.github.io/open-feed/index.html?owner=benofben&repo=benlackey-feed&path=posts

## Roadmap
* Intermingle multiple feeds
* Comments
